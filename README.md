## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Use `git clone` to download this repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ml_basics.git
   cd ml_basics
   ```
2. **Set Up the Environment**: Ensure you have Python installed along with necessary libraries. You can install dependencies using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   (Note: If a `requirements.txt` is not yet created, install common libraries like `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`, `matplotlib`, and `transformers` manually.)
3. **Run the Notebooks**: Open the notebooks in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to interact with the content.
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. **Follow the Series**: Start with `Part_1_Foundations` for basics and progress through the parts to advanced topics and specializations.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Python programming.
- Familiarity with machine learning concepts is helpful but not required, as the series starts with foundational topics.
- Tools: Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab, Python 3.x, and relevant libraries (listed above).
